In this project the aim is to put together everything I have learnt in the AWS restart course in a personal project so I can show this off in the internship class

In this I am aiming to make a FastAPI app that will do following
1. list all the anime shows I am currently watching on each day
2. have a second list that shows anime that I have watched previously

For this I will need following data:
Day
Anime
Current episode count
Status

Data I may want later:
Link to anime site to watch
